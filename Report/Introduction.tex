The work done on this project is a continuation of a previous project for an Intelligent Systems course under Dr. Flann in 2015. The original goal of the project was to create a tool that is capable of identifying biological systems that organize into regular patterns. A biological system in this case is composed of one or more cell types and their behaviors. These cells are simulated using the CompuCell3D Simulator to determine if they are "self-organizing".

The idea is that these cells and their behaviors could then be replicated in the real world where their organized patterns may prove useful. Such cells could already exist in nature or be grown in a lab through genetic engineering processes.

The continuation of this project is to parallelize the most resource intensive operation of the application, which is the simulation of the cell growth.
