{"name":"Identification of Self-Organizing Multicellular Systems","tagline":"","body":"### Cellular Self-Organization\r\nSelf-organization could be defined as the undirected movement of a chaotic structure into an ordered one. In a biological system, this may be seen as a formation of cells gradually reforms into a regular arrangement. Such arrangements could be lattices or grids that are identified as having regular or repeating patterns. These systems may prove valuable to disciplines such as medicine and bioengineering. Determining the behaviors with which to compose a self-organizing system is a nontrivial\r\ntask. While many such systems have already been identified, the considerable amount of traits comprising cellular behaviors would make an exhaustive search of undiscovered systems impossible.\r\n\r\n### What\r\nThis project implements a simple hill climber written on Python that works on a limited set of cellular behaviors from the CompuCell3D simulator. An evaluation of the set complexity of the simulated result of a biological system is used to determine self-organization and regularity (i.e. the fitness function).\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nSelf-organizing biological systems are potentially useful in medical and bioengineering fields.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
